It is a work in progress and a living document. All of the information contained within reflects what is best understood as of today, and some of is subject to change as more about the game is discovered. More importantly, this is a guide for players who want to push the envelope of their class, and be the best they can be. That is not the playstyle of every player, nor am I advocating it should be. Ultimately, you should pick your race and spec so that they’re both what you enjoy the most. To some people that is exactly what they’ll find in this guide: doing all you can do to maximize your DPS and compete with your friends, or to clear the content as fast and efficiently as possible. To some other people, it might mean playing a Night Elf and raiding as Arms - and that’s completely fine. Ultimately, both groups of players will find a guild and a community that fits them and enjoy this amazing game we love so much together. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is the aim of this guide? 2.2 What is NOT the aim of this guide", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is the aim of this guide? This guide aims to help the reader from the ground up: from the foundational mechanics of World of Warcraft (WoW) combat, to an in-depth overview of warrior abilities and their utilization, to cooldown management, raid consumables, and finally how to analyze parses and learn from your own mistakes. 2.2 What is NOT the aim of this guide DPS simulations will not be covered. There are several reasons for this, but the most important being that there are incredible, well maintained resources currently available for that exact purpose. Notable mentions include Steppenwolf’s Classic Warrior Spreadsheet (Steppenwolf 2019) and Aurana’s Classic Warrior Fury DPS Simulator (Aurana 2019). In the same vein, questions on how to (specifically) gear will not be covered in this guide. This is because gearing is highly contextual - answering questions such as “What is better, Black Dragonscale 3set or Devilsaur Set with Truestrike Shoulders?” is impossible without knowing the rest of your gear and race. Therefore, when this guide makes recommendations, please be aware that exceptions do exist, but are rare. By the end, I hope the reader is knowledgeable enough about the base mechanics to critically assess and reason any gearing questions that he or she may have. References "],
["mechanics.html", "Chapter 3 Mechanics 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Miss Chance, Glancing Blows, and Weapon Skill 3.3 The Crit Cap 3.4 Flurry", " Chapter 3 Mechanics 3.1 Introduction Combat mechanics are at the core of the warrior class, and deeply impact our talent and gearing choices and combat rotation. Therefore, it is important to build a solid foundational understanding of these mechanics in order to make the correct decisions and understand the theory behind our choices moving forward. There are two types of melee attacks: white (auto attacks) and yellow (special attacks). Yellow attacks function exactly like white attacks, except they cannot glance. Each white attack made by players against enemy mobs will result in one of the following: Miss Dodge Parry Glancing blow Block Critical Strike Hit A mob being attacked from behind cannot block or parry, and thus these two outcomes are removed from the roll table. This means our white attacks can only either miss, be dodged, glance, hit, or critically hit. Therefore, in order to maximize our damage we need to minimize \\(P(Miss)\\), \\(P(Dodge)\\) and \\(P(Glance)\\), and maximize \\(P(Crit)\\). In the subsequent sections, we will take a deeper look into how we can achieve that. 3.2 Miss Chance, Glancing Blows, and Weapon Skill 3.2.1 Miss Chance Blizzard has confirmed that players have an 8% chance to miss a creature that is 3 levels above them (Blizzard 2019b). Empirical work from Magey and others (Magey et al. 2019) further corroborates a formula originally proposed by Beaza during vanilla (Beaza 2006), which can be summarized as: If the target is mob and the difference between it’s defense rating and the attacker’s weapon skill is 11 or more: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(Miss\\right)\\ =\\ 0.05\\ +\\ \\left(\\left(T_{lvl}\\times 5\\right)-Atk_{skill}\\right)\\times 0.2 \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] If the target is mob and the difference between it’s defense rating and the attacker’s weapon skill is 10 or less: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(Miss\\right)\\ =\\ 0.05\\ +\\ \\left(\\left(T_{lvl}\\times 5\\right)-Atk_{skill}\\right)\\times 0.1 \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(T_{lvl}\\) is the target’s level, and \\(Atk_{skill}\\) is the attacker’s weapon skill rating. While simple, this formula carries immense significance - it means that that by having 305 weapon skill, a player only has a 6% chance to miss an enemy mob 3 levels higher, which includes raid bosses. Conversely, a player with only 300 weapon skill will have an 8% chance to miss. This is a huge difference, especially in conjunction with the other benefits that weapon skill brings. It is important to note, however, that this is the behavior exhibited by wielding one one-handed weapon. If dual wielding, probability of missing an attack is calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(DW_{miss}\\right)\\ =\\ \\left(P\\left(Miss\\right)\\ \\times\\ 0.8\\right)\\ +\\ 0.2 \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] As a disclaimer, Magey notes that further testing is still required to assert the correctness of this formula. 3.2.2 Glancing Blows Glancing blows are a type of attack that can only occur when fighting an enemy of equal or higher value, and are restricted to white attacks. In accordance with Beaza, Magey et al. have determined the glancing blow probability to be as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(Glancing\\right)\\ =\\ 0.1\\ +\\ \\left(T_{lvl}\\times5\\ -\\ \\min\\left(Atk_{lvl}\\times 5,\\ Atk_{skill}\\right)\\right)\\times 0.2 \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Atk_{lvl}\\) is the player’s level, and \\(Atk_{skill}\\) is the player’s weapon skill value. Knowing that, we can compute the probability that our white attacks will glance, and the damage penalty that that glancing blow carries against enemies of different levels: Table 3.1: Glancing blow probability and damage penalty per level difference. Level Difference Probability Damage Penalty 0 0.1 0.05 1 0.2 0.05 2 0.3 0.15 3 0.4 0.35 This means that against a level 63 enemy mob (all raid bosses) and with 300 weapon skill our white attacks have a 40% chance of being glancing blows, therefore only being capable of dealing 65% of their maximum damage. Needless to say this is an immense DPS loss and should be mitigated as much as possible, and the only way that can be done is through increasing the player’s weapon skill. 3.2.3 Weapon Skill Magey’s work again corroborate the impact of weapon skill on glancing blow probability, damage, and miss probability according to Beaza’s formulas ((3.4), (3.1) and (3.2)). The table below summarizes that impact, but it is important to note that not all values have been experimentally confirmed due to the difficulty in acquiring specific weapon skill values that inherently comes from WoW itemization. Table 3.2: Weapon skill impact on glancing blow damage reduction, miss chance, and hit cap. Damage increase is relative to 300 weapon skill. Weapon Skill Percent of White Attack Glancing Blow Damage Increase Miss Probability Hit Cap 300 0.65 0.0000000 0.080 0.090 301 0.69 0.0615385 0.078 0.088 302 0.73 0.1230769 0.076 0.086 303 0.77 0.1846154 0.074 0.084 304 0.81 0.2461538 0.072 0.082 305 0.85 0.3076923 0.060 0.060 306 0.89 0.3692308 0.059 0.059 307 0.93 0.4307692 0.058 0.058 308 0.95 0.4615385 0.057 0.057 309 0.95 0.4615385 0.056 0.056 310 0.95 0.4615385 0.055 0.055 311 0.95 0.4615385 0.054 0.054 312 0.95 0.4615385 0.053 0.053 313 0.95 0.4615385 0.052 0.052 314 0.95 0.4615385 0.051 0.051 315 0.95 0.4615385 0.050 0.050 As we can see, weapon skill not only reduces the glancing blow damage penalty, it also reduces the hit cap and the \\(P(Miss)\\). The glancing blow damage penalty reduction is more easily shown graphically: Figure 3.1: Weapon skill greatly reduces the glancing blow damage penalty Figure 3.2: Weapon skill increases damage on glancing, relative to 300 weapon skill. As we can see, our glancing blows increase in damage linearly with weapon skill until 307 weapon skill. This is incredibly important, as it indicates 308 weapon skill to being the soft cap for glancing blow damage penalty reduction - meaning the player gains no benefits in this aspect if their weapon skill is higher than 307 when facing a raid boss. Similarly, the impact of weapon skill on the \\(P(Miss)\\) and hit cap is clearer when shown graphically: Figure 3.3: Weapon skill contributes to overcome the 1% hit suppression and the miss probability, but suffers steep diminishing returns after 305. As we can see, the player’s hit cap starts 1% higher than \\(P(Miss)\\) at 305 weapon skill. This is because vanilla WoW code explicitly suppresses the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear against enemy mobs with more than 10 defense skill above the player’s weapon skill (Blizzard 2019a), in accordance with (3.1). This hit suppression is not applied, however, if the difference between the attacker’s weapon skill and the enemy mob’s defense skill is less than 10 (3.2). Not that values past 305 weapon skill suffer from steep diminishing returns, where an increase of 10 points past that only translates to a hit cap decrease of 1%. This is why weapon skill is so important: not only does it reduce the glancing blow damage penalty, it removes the inherit 1% hit modifier, and adds a significant amount of hit until 305. This is also why a weapon skill of at least 305 and at most 308 is highly recommended. The first 5 points are crucial to overcome the 1% hit deficit, and the 8 points enables us to reach the maximum glancing blow damage. This is a complicated threshold to reach, however, as there are very few items in World of Warcraft that add small amounts of Weapon Skill that would enable you to get to 308. Furthermore, the fact that weapon skill’s value in respect to hit chance is vastly diminished after 305 clearly indicates that 305 weapon skill is the most optimal weapon skill value for Fury Warriors in Classic WoW. This is why any weapon skill bonus of over 5, whether given by a racial (orcs with axes, humans with maces and swords) or an item is so good - it means that single piece of gear is enough to overcome the hit suppresion versus raid bosses, as well as giving you 2% hit and glancing blow damage penalty reduction. This is an incredible advantage, especially compared to the alternative which is gearing for weapon skill through items such as Edgemaster’s Handguards, since the player with the built in weapon skill essentially has one extra item slot over a non-human, non-orc player. This is also why items that give good stats in addition to weapon skill, such as Aged Core Leather Gloves, incredibly good. 3.3 The Crit Cap 3.4 Flurry References "],

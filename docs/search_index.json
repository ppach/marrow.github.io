Therefore, it is important to build a solid foundational understanding of these mechanics in order to make the correct decisions and understand the theory behind our choices moving forward. A warrior’s melee attacks in World of Warcraft can be divided into two categories: white (auto attacks) and yellow (special attacks, such as Bloodthirst). This distinction is important, as the roll that ultimately decides the fate of the attack works differently in each case - while white attacks utilize a one roll table, special attacks utilize a to roll table. 3.2 White Attacks Each white attack made by players against enemy mobs will result in one of the following: Miss Dodge Parry Glancing blow Block Critical Strike Hit 3.3 Miss Chance, Weapon Skill, and Glancing Blows Blizzard has confirmed that players have an 8% chance to miss a creature that is 3 levels above them (Blizzard 2019). Empirical work from (Magey et al. 2019) further corroborates a formula originally proposed by Beaza during vanilla (Beaza 2006), which can be summarized as: If the target is mob and the difference between it’s defense rating and the attacker’s weapon skill is 11 or more: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(Miss\\right)\\ =\\ 0.05\\ +\\ \\left(\\left(T_{lvl}\\cdot5\\right)-Atk_{skill}\\right)\\cdot0.2 \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] If the target is mob and the difference between it’s defense rating and the attacker’s weapon skill is 10 or less: \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(Miss\\right)\\ =\\ 0.05\\ +\\ \\left(\\left(T_{lvl}\\cdot5\\right)-Atk_{skill}\\right)\\cdot0.1 \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(T_{lvl}\\) is the target’s level, and \\(Atk_{skill}\\) is the attacker’s weapon skill rating. While simple, this formula carries immense significance - it means that that by having 305 weapon skill, a player only has a 6% chance to miss an enemy mob 3 levels higher, which includes raid bosses. Conversely, a player with only 300 weapon skill will have an 8% chance to miss. This is a huge difference, especially in conjunction with the other benefits that weapon skill brings (and which will be further analyzed in the weapon skill 3.4 Glancing Blows 3.5 Weapon Skill 3.6 The Crit Cap 3.7 Flurry References "]
